      //How to know which product to add
      // Data Attribute: is just another HTML attribute, it allows us to attach any information to an element
      // eg;<element data-product-name="..." / data-id =
      // ..></element>

      //syntax rules
      //name = value;
      //data attribute have to start with "data"

      //Modules
      //- a better way to organize our code
      //- module just contain a variable inside a file prevent naming conflict

      //create a module
      //1-create a file
      //2-don't load the file with <script>
      //*Any variable we create inside the file, will be contained inside the file.

      //get variable out of module
      //1-add type="module" attribute;
      //2-Export
      //3-Import

      //more thing we need to know about module
      //1-Put all imports at the top of the file.
      //2- We need to use live server;

      //benfits of module
      //1- Helps us avoiding naming conflits
      //2-Don't have to worry about order of files

      // method
      //       import { cart, addToCart } from "../data/cart.js";
      // // import { cart as myCart } from "../data/cart.js"; --rename as cart to myCart

      // import * as nameRel from "file-path"-will import everything and save to nameRel

      ///De dupicating the data /Normalizing the data: pass id or other details to the all data of a prodauct and acess all by data

      //external library -code that is outside of our projects

      //Why we use external libraries
      //-let us share code
      //-save time
      //-avoid duplicating work

      ///MVC:makes sure the page always matches the data

      //M-Model:saves and manages the data
      //V-View;takes the data and displays it on the page
      //C-controller
